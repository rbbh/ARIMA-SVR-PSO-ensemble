# ARIMA-SVR-PSO-ensemble

This repository focuses on a completely new approach on predicting time series. The system ARIMA + the SVR and PSO ensemble. The ensemble makes the predictions of the residuals generated by the ARIMA model on any time series and, then, the system adjusts the original predictions by summing up the predicted residuals with the original predicitons. 

The accuracy of the system is proved to be more accurate than the ARIMA.
